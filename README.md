# Webscrapping-Using-BeautifulSoup-Unstructured-Data-Source--HTML-

## The data for the models is often kept in both structured and unstructured data sources. However, becauseÂ most of sources are unstructured, a method to extract the necessary information / data for machine learning model creation is required.

## This beautifulsoup webscraping project is part of the data collection process for developing a machine learning algorithm that can identify bird kinds, families, and orders from a bird photograph.


## In total, there are 618 distinct bird species in this extract, divided into 75 families and 22 bird orders.
